### üõ†Ô∏è Build Your Documentation

As a meticulously designed markdown file generator, ReadMeGenius empowers you to streamline the documentation process with ease. Elevate your project's professionalism and ensure comprehensive documentation with this invaluable tool. Here's an interesting tidbit, the baseline for this README was *generated* by this very project! 

### üöÄ Features

### üåê Open
ReadMeGenius is an open-source project built with the goal of making project documentation easier and more accessible to everyone. My commitment to openness means that this repository is open to the public, inviting exploration and encouraging creativity. Please feel free to delve into the codebase, generate markdown files, fork the project, and customize it to suit your specific needs. 

### üí≠ Developer Notes
- ReadMeGenius' Inquirer package has been updated to use version `^9.2.8.`
- Asynchronous operations now utilize Async/Await expressions, moving away from promises.
- Users now have the ability to add multiple inputs within each section.

The creation of ReadMeGenius was an educational journey. Throughout the development process, I used the opportunity to solidify my coding knowledge, building upon the concepts I had previously learned from a different project, PortfolioForge. Simultaneously, I used this experience to introduce new ideas and improve the content of this markdown generator.

For example: 
1. generateMarkdown.js utilizes regex and .replace() to remove extra spacing
  - `data.replace(/^(?:\t| {2,})/gm, '')`
2. Using newly learned syntax to create a new line for each section/subsection
  - `\n`

In the future I'd like to create a more extensive version of ReadMeGenius that allows users to add more to their markdown files. Such as images, bullet points, and so on.

### üôè Thank You!
So much for checking out ReadMeGenius, my intention is that it proves helpful to you in creating documentation for your own projects. Furthermore I hope the code base itself is able to help you out however possible. Please feel free to fork this repo, I hope you find ReadMeGenius a helpful addition to your development toolkit and happy coding!
